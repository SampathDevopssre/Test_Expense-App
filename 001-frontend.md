Frontend
Expense App Frontend or UI is developed by using React and has to be deployed by using a web-server Nginx

Who decides the type of Web-Server to be used ?
    In our case, we selected to use nginx and it's also the suggested entity from Developer.
    Nginx is also one of the highly used Web-Server 

Nginx will have the webframe for the web application.

Our application servers static content and we need a web server to perform the same:

Install Nginx On The Top Of The Server-01
    # dnf install nginx -y  

    [ Hint : dnf is the package manager on RHEL9 ]
Start & Enable Nginx service
    # systemctl enable nginx       [ Enabling the service will keep the service to be started automatically when server goes for a boot ]
    # systemctl start nginx 
!!! Try to access the service once over the browser and ensure you get some default content.

    1) Open your browser 
    2) IP Address 
    3) You should be able to see some default content and thus proves your nginx is working 
Remove the default content as we have our content developed and shared to us by the frontend developer
    # rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*          [ Nginx path where web content is stored ]

Download the web-content for frontend
    # curl -o /tmp/frontend.zip https://expense-web-app.s3.amazonaws.com/frontend.zip
Extract the frontend content.
    # cd /usr/share/nginx/html 
    # unzip /tmp/frontend.zip
!!! Try to access the nginx service once more over the browser and ensure you get expense content.

Create Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration.
    # vim /etc/nginx/default.d/expense.conf   ( empty the file if any and add the below content )

proxy_http_version 1.1;

location /api/ { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/; }

location /health {
stub_status on;
access_log off;
}
Above reverse proxy config plays a critical role and you'll get this more when detailing with backend.

!!! NOTE : Replace the localhost with the private ip address of your backend server. Word localhost is just used to avoid the failures on the Nginx Server.

Restart Nginx Service to load the changes of the configuration.
    # systemctl restart nginx 
    # systemctl status nginx           ( service should show up as running, if not, you'd have made some mistakes above )
proceed with 002-mysql
